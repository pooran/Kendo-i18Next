Kendo-i18Next
=============

Integrating Telerik Globalization Kendo demo  ( http://trykendoui.telerik.com/oDos ) with i18Next ( www.i18next.com ) 

Culture in Telerik Kendo defines specific information for the number formats, week and month names, date and time formats and etc. You can also override the controls to give parts of the control to display text like you need. But for an app, that is not the end of it. We will have lot of content that needs Internationalized. 

With Telerik open sourcing Kendo Core, and Kendo mobile being part of it with few less commerical controls, it is still a good bet for most common mobile apps. I have used i18next extensively. One of the project needed to integrate i18Next with kendo and needed a proof of concept, and hence this sample.
